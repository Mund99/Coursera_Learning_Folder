You'll follow these steps:\n","\n","1.   Explore the example data of `Dogs vs. Cats`\n","2.   Build and train a neural network to classify between the two pets\n","3.

For instance, if you, as a human, only see three images of people who are lumberjacks, and three images of people who are sailors, and among them the only person wearing a cap is a lumberjack, you might start thinking that wearing a cap is a sign of being a lumberjack as opposed to a sailor. You would then make a pretty lousy lumberjack/sailor classifier.\n","\n","Overfitting is the central problem in machine learning: given that you are fitting the parameters of our model to a given dataset, how can you make sure that the representations learned by the model will be applicable to data it has never seen before?
