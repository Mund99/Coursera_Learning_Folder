These generators will yield batches of images of size 300x300 and their labels (binary).\n","\n","As you may already know, data that goes into neural networks should usually be normalized in some way to make it more amenable to processing by the network (i.e. It is uncommon to feed raw pixels into a ConvNet.) In this case, you will preprocess the images by normalizing the pixel values to be in the `[0, 1]` range (originally all values are in the `[0, 255]` range).\n","\n","In Keras, this can be done via the `keras.preprocessing.image.ImageDataGenerator` class using the `rescale` parameter.
